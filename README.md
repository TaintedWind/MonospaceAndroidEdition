MonospaceAndroidEdition
=======================

The port of Monospace by Computerology to android. 
Check out the original work here: https://github.com/Computerology/Monospace

Currently being developed by TaintedWind, but with the collaboration of Computerology as well.

It's being built targeted to Android 5.0 (Lollipop), but but has a minimum of Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).


Note
----

This is being developed almost fully programmatically, as this is my first android application. I'm sorry.
